## Exercise 1: The **SWISSPROT database**
The SWISSPROT database is freely available for use in academic research. It is a collaborative project between the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. The database is created by translation of protein coding sequences in the EMBL nucleic acid sequence database. There is a large team of curators, who create the sequence entries and annotations manually. This is a major task, and the reason why funding is now being raised by charging for commercial use of the database. The real value of SWISSPROT is in the annotations, which include functional information, information about active sites, sequence variations, three-dimensional structure, etc. Annotations are often produced in collaboration with experts on particular protein families. There are also extensive links to other databases.

A good way to view SWISSPROT entries is to use the uniprot server at the EBI.

Go to this site: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/services/   
Choose the UniProt database (which includes SWISSPROT as well as the less well annotated TrEMBL database)
Click on the Standard Query Form button.
Do a search using the terms "**escherichia coli**" and "**serine protease**".
Browse some of the UniProt entries you find.

Note the types of information and database links available.
