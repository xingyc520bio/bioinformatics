# Exercise 3: The InterPro protein domain family databases
The NCK1_HUMAN sequence will also be familiar from the previous practical. 
Find the FASTA formated sequence using the search box at the UNIPROT database (as in the previous practical). 
Highlight and copy the sequence.

Remember that we deduced some things about its domain organisation by looking at the alignments from sequence searches and looking at self similarity. 
Now try submitting the sequence to InterPro. 
Paste the sequence into the form and click Search. 
It may take some time to run. 
The InterPro database integrates PROSITE (Hofmann,K. et al. 1999), 
PRINTS (Attwood,T. K. et al. 2000), Pfam (Bateman,A. et al. 2000), 
ProDom (Corpet,F. et al. 1999), SMART (Schultz,J.et al. 2000) and TIGRFAMs (Haft,D.H. et al. 2001) databases. 
It returns a concensus prediction of the protein domain structure.

Viewing the results most of the secondary databases have produced the same domain structure (i.e. 3 x SH3 domain and 1 x SH2 domain). 
Click on the links to each of the sites for the SH3 domain asignments. Have a quick look at the information provided. 
Which do you find most informative?

SMART
Hint: Go to the Glossary from the SMART homepage.

Clicking on the links to the domain matches (on the right) will take you to a summary page for that domain. 
Clicking on "Domain Architectures" gives a list of the unique domain organisations in which this domain is found. 
This may help in understanding the functional significance of your query sequence search. For example, click on SH2 doman. 
Select "Domain Architecture"; scrolling down you will find there are a group of sequences with the following architecture: 
SH3_1 x 3, SH2 - identical to NCK1_HUMAN. 
You may need to scroll past 20 first results. 
Clicking on "there are 292 proteins" with this architecture will give you the list of NCK1 proteins.
