# Exercise 5: Another example.
This example is a real question which was of interest to an experimental scientist of the School. It concerns a sequence from ***Arabidopsis***.

## Arabidopsis
***Can you find any other similar sequences from the same organism?***
You can just run this job:

The skip this:

Then get the result:

Yes, I think so.

## Yeast
***Are there any similar sequences in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).***
You can run the job like this:

Then get a window like this:

Click the window and get the result:
![image](https://github.com/xingyc520bio/bioinformatics/assets/49332831/4da29f19-5570-462c-93fa-50caae9aa4e7)

You can see that there are less similar sequence.


***Which yeast sequence is most likely to be the ortholog?***
The first one:

Try searches initially against SWISSPROT and also with the larger UniProt database available on the EBI WWW site.     
Or try the NCBI site and Blastp with the nr (none redundant) database.

## Structure
***Is there a homologue in the pdb structural database?***   
Goto PDBsum and find out about the top 2-3 proteins you have identified.    
The link is: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/pdbsum/

### Structure 1:

### Structure 2:

***What is the secondary structure configuration and CATH fold type?***

Click on the link to PROCHECK and look at the Ramachandran plot.      
Is there anything unusal about the structure?     
If you are unsure ask a demonstrator.
