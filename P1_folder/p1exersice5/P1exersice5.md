Exercise 5: Another example.
This example is a real question which was of interest to an experimental scientist of the School. It concerns a sequence from ***Arabidopsis***.

Can you find any other similar sequences from the same organism? Are there any similar sequences in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). 
Which yeast sequence is most likely to be the ortholog? Try searches initially against SWISSPROT and also with the larger UniProt database available on the EBI WWW site. 
Or try the NCBI site and Blastp with the nr (none redundant) database

Is there a homologue in the pdb structural database?

Goto PDBsum and find out about the top 2-3 proteins you have identified.

What is the secondary structure configuration and CATH fold type? Click on the link to PROCHECK and look at the Ramachandran plot. Is there anything unusal about the structure? If you are unsure ask a demonstrator.
